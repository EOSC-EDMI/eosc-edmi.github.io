    <h1>1st Report on Data Interoperability: Findability and Interoperability</h1>
    
    <p>
        EOSCpilot has produced a first draft of the strategy and recommendations to help users and services to find and access datasets
        across several scientific disciplines. This strategy relies on three main ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agreeing on a common and minimum dataset metadata properties to be exposed by data resources (following evaluation of
            existing metadata models and APIs).</li>
        <li>Supporting a coordinated ecosystem of dataset metadata catalogues working together to efficiently manage and exchange
            their metadata.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the applicability of these recommendations by implementing them in real use cases to allow users services
            to find and access data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    
    <p>The recommendations of this working group are driven by a set of guiding principles which can be grouped into three categories:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Reuse - Leverage upon the rich legacy of Research Infrastructures</li>
        <li>Least - Converge upon the minimum set of metadata from which we can derive maximum benefit</li>
        <li>Practical - Recommend solutions that are sustainable, pragmatic and easy to deliver</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Components</h2>
    
    <p>
        One of the core outcomes from the draft guideline outlines are three components judged to be important for the implementation
        of this strategy
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>EDMI metadata guidelines:</strong> EOSC Datasets Minimum Information. A set of metadata properties and a metadata
            crosswalk (equivalence) across existing metadata models. <a href="https://eoscpilot.eu/edmi-metadata-guidelines" target="_blank">More...</a></li>
        <li>
            <strong>Metadata catalogues strategy:</strong> Recommendations about how to support an ecosystem of metadata catalogues. <a href="https://eoscpilot.eu/metadata-catalogues-strategy" target="_blank">More...</a></li>
        <li>
            <strong>Demonstrators:</strong> And set of demonstrators to validate and iteratively improve the proposed recommendations. <a href="https://eoscpilot.eu/demonstrators" target="_blank">More...</a></li>
