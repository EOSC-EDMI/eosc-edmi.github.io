Resupended into 25mls SHSY5Y complete media. 1ml dispensed per well (into 2mls media) using repeat pipette. \n Sample Processing - CMAP miRNA transfection. 1nM concentration of miRNA per cell (6.2uls of 500nM/ul) transfected with 2.4uls.well turbofect. Cells with methamphetamine: 10nM methamphetamine\n Hybridization - Affymetrix Generic Hybridization\n Labeling - Labeling of samples was carried out according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol\n Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNAprotect 1ml added. Cells frozen at -80C. EXtraction using RNeasy Plus Kit."
